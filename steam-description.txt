Sick of that old green steel tool cabinet? Yeah, me too. Now you can make tool cabinets out of stuff!

The original recipe was 200 steel; the new recipe is [b]50 steel + 150 woody or metallic stuff[/b].

Bonus feature: Stuffable tool cabinets can be painted! Want a pink wooden tool cabinet? You can have it!
